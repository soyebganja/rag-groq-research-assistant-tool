And stakeholders aren’t expecting much of a rebound in the coming months either, despite expanding housing supply and slowing home price growth giving buyers more options and greater negotiating power. The fact that many prospective home buyers remain on the sidelines even with these improving conditions signals they’re holding out for more clarity on the economy and their own financial situations. Meanwhile, mortgage rates staying stuck in the upper 6% range isn’t helping to ease the affordability challenges buyers face, a strain that experts predict will persist for at least the remainder of 2025. Housing Market Forecast 2025 U.S. home prices posted a 2.3% annual gain in May—the slowest annual appreciation since mid-2023—down from the 2.7% growth released in April, according to the latest S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which tracks single-family home values and is calculated monthly using a three-month moving average. This report tracked March through May. Despite the deceleration in price growth, the index still hit another record high, underscoring how elevated home values remain. Still, the slowing pace of price increases, along with the ongoing rise in housing stock, would suggest that the landscape has begun shifting to a buyer’s market. But would-be buyers aren’t biting. Home sales remain anemic. Buyers are also backing out of sales contracts in record numbers. Redfin revealed in a 2025 analysis that nearly 15% of home purchase agreements fell through in June , the highest June reading since tracking began in 2017. “[T]he slowdown is now more than just a story of higher mortgage rates,” said Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in the report. “It reflects a market recalibrating around tighter",

Redfin revealed in a 2025 analysis that nearly 15% of home purchase agreements fell through in June , the highest June reading since tracking began in 2017. “[T]he slowdown is now more than just a story of higher mortgage rates,” said Nicholas Godec, head of fixed income tradables and commodities at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in the report. “It reflects a market recalibrating around tighter financial conditions, subdued transaction volumes and increasingly local dynamics.” In other words, the housing market is stuck in neutral, and that’s unlikely to change in 2025. “Home sales activity is likely to remain slow in the second half of the year and overall sales could end the year at or below last year’s historically low levels,” said Lisa Sturtevant, chief economist at real estate agency Bright MLS, in emailed commentary. Will the Housing Market Crash in 2025? With record-high home prices still trending upward in many markets amid economic uncertainty, you may be concerned that we’re in a bubble that’s primed to pop, as it did in the 2008 financial crisis. However, the likelihood of a housing market crash (a rapid drop in unsustainably high home prices due to waning demand) remains low in 2025. Housing stock supply has risen substantially compared to last year, yet overall inventory is still well below pre-pandemic levels. “[T]he record low supply of houses on the market protects against a market crash,” says Tom Hutchens, executive vice president of production at Angel Oak Mortgage Solutions, a nonqualified mortgage lender. Experts are also quick to point out that today’s homeowners are on much more secure footing than those coming out of the 2008 financial crisis, with many having substantial home equity. What’s more, a record number of homeowners today are mortgage-free. When Will the Housing Market Recover? At a minimum, for a housing recovery to occur, two primary conditions must improve. Housing Inventory Needs To Increase “For the best possible outcome, we’d first need to see inventories of homes for sale turn considerably higher,” Keith Gumbinger, vice president at online mortgage company HSH.com, tells Forbes Advisor. “This additional inventory, in turn, would ease the upward pressure on home prices, leveling them off or perhaps helping them to settle back somewhat from peak or near-peak levels.” Mortgage Rates Need To Fall Additionally, mortgage rates need to decline to see a meaningful increase in housing market activity. However, with rates firmly stuck above 6.5% for nine months, hopes are dwindling for much improvement over the remainder of the year. Meanwhile, in a widely expected move, the Federal Reserve left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at its July meeting. Many watchers anticipate a rate cut in September, which could indirectly influence a drop in mortgage rates ahead of the decision, much like what happened in the lead-up to the September 2024 meeting when rates declined in anticipation of the Fed rate cut. Still, with so much economic uncertainty",

Many watchers anticipate a rate cut in September, which could indirectly influence a drop in mortgage rates ahead of the decision, much like what happened in the lead-up to the September 2024 meeting when rates declined in anticipation of the Fed rate cut. Still, with so much economic uncertainty and political noise, the Fed’s next move remains difficult to predict. So, what do most experts feel certain about? Whatever the Fed does, don’t expect a steep drop in mortgage rates—but that’s a good thing. Gumbinger warns that rates cooling too quickly could create a surge in demand that would wipe away any inventory gains, causing home prices to spike. He adds that mortgage rates eventually returning to a more “normal” upper-4%-to-lower-5% range would be helpful to the housing market, but predicts it could be a while before we return to those rates. How Do Today’s Monthly Payments and Long-Term Interest Costs Compare to Last Year? The Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator makes it easy for new homeowners to estimate what they’ll pay monthly and how much interest they’ll shell out in the long run. For instance, in June, a typical home cost roughly $369,000 according to Zillow data. Buyers who put down 20% on a house and financed at a 6.77% mortgage rate—the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate the last week of June—have a monthly principal and interest payment of $1,918. In contrast, homeowners who bought a home at the same time in 2024, at the typical price of around $367,400 when the mortgage rate was 6.86%, are paying $1,927 a month. In this scenario, new homeowners are paying $9 less each month and saving $4,633 in mortgage interest over the life of the loan compared to buyers who purchased homes a year ago. While the difference in this example isn’t dramatic, the bigger rate decline many are holding out for could significantly reduce monthly payments and bolster overall interest savings. Remember, though, you’ll also need to pay monthly property taxes, insurance and potentially other costs such as homeowners association fees or additional homeowners insurance coverage. Entering those details into our calculator will give you a more accurate view of your monthly costs.

Residential Real Estate Stats: Existing, New and Pending Home Sales Summer housing activity has been wilting in the heat, and many experts predict the sluggishness will persist into the coming months. Here’s a look at what’s happening in the housing market. Existing-Home Sales Existing-home sales, which include completed transactions of previously occupied single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, receded amid steep mortgage rates, record-high home prices and buyers holding out for more economic certainty.

Here’s a look at what’s happening in the housing market. Existing-Home Sales Existing-home sales, which include completed transactions of previously occupied single-family homes, townhomes, condominiums and co-ops, receded amid steep mortgage rates, record-high home prices and buyers holding out for more economic certainty. The National Association of Realtors (NAR) reported that monthly sales declined 2.7% in June, putting the seasonally adjusted annual sales rate at 3.93 million, down from 4.04 million in May. Year-over-year sales saw no change. In the report, Lawrence Yun, chief economist at NAR, blamed high mortgage rates for paralyzing home sales activity. Meanwhile, home prices aren’t cooperating either. The national median resale home price rose 2% from a year ago to $435,300, marking the highest June on record and the 24th straight month of year-over-year price growth. However, regional price disparities remain pronounced. For example, the median resale home price in the Midwest rose 3.4% from a year ago to $337,600, compared to the West, which increased only 1%, but to a median sales price of $636,100. Unsold inventory remained fairly steady, sitting at a 4.7-month supply at the current monthly sales pace, up from 4.6 months in May. Most experts consider a balanced market to be between four and six months. New Home Sales Sales of newly built homes also slowed in June. The latest U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) data revealed that seasonally adjusted new home sales increased by a marginal 0.6% between May and June but fell by 6.6% compared to last year. Only the Midwest saw monthly and annualized sales increases. Among the other three regions, the Northeast posted the steepest monthly and annualized decreases. But there was some good news for would-be buyers: as sales dropped, so did prices. The median new home sales price fell by 4.9% in June and by 2.9% from a year ago, according to the data. ​​ “These falling prices reflect the recent trends of builders delivering smaller and more affordable homes to the market, but also the harsh reality that demand for homes is waning as more buyers simply decide that they cannot afford a new home purchase under current market conditions,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com, in an emailed statement. Meanwhile, monthly inventory of newly built homes rose from an estimated 9.7 months to 9.8 months supply in June. The June reading also surpasses the 8.4-month level recorded a year ago. “The sluggish pace of sales combined with growing new home inventory has driven the new home segment deep into buyers’ market territory,” Berner said.

Seasonally adjusted contract signings fell 0.8% between May and June, according to NAR’s Pending Homes Sales Index, with all U.S. regions posting monthly declines except the Northeast, which posted a 2.1% gain. Compared to last year, pending transactions slid 2.8%, with all regions posting monthly declines except the Northeast, which remained unchanged. A pending home sale marks the point in the purchase transaction when the buyer and seller agree on price and terms and is considered a leading indicator of a closed existing home sale within the next one to two months. Regardless of these disappointing numbers, NAR put on an optimistic front, expecting pending sales to rebound based on its Realtors Confidence Index. However, not all experts share the same rosy projection. “Prospective home buyers are increasingly anxious about the overall economy and their own personal financial situations,” Sturtevant said. “Unfortunately, there is little to suggest any sort of major rebound in home sales as we head into fall.“ Housing Inventory Forecast: When Will There Be Sufficient Supply To Reduce Prices? After several years of record-low inventory, the supply of homes has risen notably over the past year. If the trend continues, buyers sidelined by affordability challenges may find themselves with more options—as long as they know where to look Here are factors impacting the inventory landscape. The Lock-In Effect is Beginning To Unlock Rick Sharga, founder and CEO of CJ Patrick Company, a market intelligence and business advisory firm, tells Forbes Advisor that inventory is up over 33% from 2024 and appears to be on track to hit pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year, or possibly earlier. There are multiple reasons for this improvement, one of which is the loosening of the “lock-in effect,” a situation where homeowners with ultra-low rates—such as the high-2% to 4% rates seen during the pandemic years—are disincentivised to sell due to their rates being well below current levels. “Rate lock is still a legitimate concern, but becoming less of an issue over time,” says Sharga. Indeed, according to real estate tech company Redfin, 82.8% of homeowners today have rates below 6% down from a high of 92.7% in mid-2022. However, there are still many homeowners sitting on a good rate who need a major life event reason to sell, such as a job transfer, job loss, marriage, divorce or death, says",

However, there are still many homeowners sitting on a good rate who need a major life event reason to sell, such as a job transfer, job loss, marriage, divorce or death, says Sharga. What’s Driving the Inventory Growth? It Depends on the Region The overall market still slightly favors sellers, as supply remains near the lower end of what’s considered a balanced market. However, inventory levels vary widely by region. Markets like Austin and San Antonio, Texas, and Tampa, Florida, where prices surged during the pandemic, are seeing increased supply and slowing price growth. “[T]here are a number of states, particularly Florida and Texas, which already have more for sale inventory than they did prior to the pandemic, and where demand has weakened,” says Sharga. “In those areas, the market is tilting in favor of buyers.” On the flip side, areas in the Midwest and parts of the Northeast—such as Buffalo and Rochester, New York, Cleveland and Pittsburgh—that didn’t experience skyrocketing price increases and a surge in newly-built homes have lower inventory and face increased competition among buyers. How Declining Mortgage Rates Could Impact Supply, Home Prices Given the pent-up demand for homes, a decline in mortgage rates—especially a sharp one—could quickly shrink housing supply. “We’re in an incredibly rate-sensitive environment today, and every time we’ve seen mortgage rates drop into the low-to-mid 6% range, we’ve seen an influx of buyers hit the market,” says Sharga. Sharga adds that rates dropping to 6% would likely motivate more homeowners to sell. Even so, he says many buyers will still be shut out of the market due to other rising home-related costs. “[H]ome prices have gone up almost 50% over the past five years, property taxes have risen along with them, and homeowner’s insurance premiums rose by 24% between 2020-2024,” says Sharga. “So even though there’s definitely some pent-up demand, a one-point dip in mortgage rates probably wouldn’t bring so many buyers to market that it would overwhelm the supply and cause another huge spike in home prices.” And speaking of home prices, here’s what the latest home values look like around the country. Cautious Builder Optimism Emerges Amid Persistent Affordability Challenges, Fewer Home Starts After trending downward for most of the year, builder sentiment rose in July. Yet, despite the gain, housing starts continued to fizzle, as economic concerns and elevated mortgage rates deterred buyers and hampered builders.

Builder Confidence Edges Up With Passing of One Big Beautiful Bill Builder sentiment brightened last month—although only slightly— with the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market index inching up from 32 to 33 in July. Nonetheless, confidence remains solidly in negative territory thanks to trade policy headwinds, elevated mortgage rates and economic jitters. A reading of 50 or above means more builders see good conditions ahead for new construction. The last time a reading was above 50 was April 2024. “The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act provided a number of important wins for households, home builders and small businesses,” said Buddy Hughes, chairman at NAHB, in a press statement. “While this new law should provide economic momentum after a disappointing spring, the housing sector has weakened in 2025 due to poor affordability conditions, particularly from elevated interest rates.” Could This Summer Be the Best Time To Snag a Hot Deal on a New Home? The ongoing challenges for builders are good news for shoppers looking to purchase a newly built home. Notably, the portion of builders offering price cuts in July rose to 38% compared to 29% in April. That’s the highest figure since 2022, when NAHB began tracking this data monthly. Additionally, newly built homes have seen an average monthly 5% sales price reduction since November, and 62% of builders continue to use sales incentives to sweeten the pot. Builders have also been feeling the squeeze from rising resale inventory and cooling buyer demand, adding pressure on new home prices and sales, especially in regions with a glut of unsold new homes like Texas and Florida. New Home Starts Decline Amid Economic Jitters, Buyer Pullback Prospective home buyers, take heed: A slowdown in new construction activity is fully underway. Single-family housing starts fell 4.6% in June from the previous month and 10% from a year ago, according to 2025 U.S. Census Bureau and HUD data. Completions sank 12.5% from May to June and 15.5% compared to a year ago. “Until consumers feel more confident about the state of the economy, new residential construction will remain slow,” said Sturtevant. Even so, the steep decline in annualized housing starts, coupled with negative builder sentiment, suggests buyers could face a smaller selection of newly built homes—and increased competition—next year, especially if mortgage rates hit 6% in 2026, as some experts are predicting. Are We Headed for a Foreclosure Surge in the Second Half of 2025? Lenders began foreclosures on 140,006 properties nationwide in the first half of 2025. This figure is up 7% from the same period last year and 41% from the first half of 2020, according to the Mid-Year 2025 U.S. Foreclosure Market Report released by real estate data firm Attom. While data on foreclosure starts indicated a clear upward trend, completed foreclosure data showed mixed findings, with real",

This figure is up 7% from the same period last year and 41% from the first half of 2020, according to the Mid-Year 2025 U.S. Foreclosure Market Report released by real estate data firm Attom. While data on foreclosure starts indicated a clear upward trend, completed foreclosure data showed mixed findings, with real estate-owned properties , or REOs, rising 12% compared to the first half of 2024, but declining 7% from the first half of 2023. REOs are homes that didn’t sell at foreclosure auctions, with mortgage lenders ultimately taking possession. Foreclosure Rise Suggests Signs of Financial Strain So, does this upward trend in foreclosure activity signal a looming surge like the one triggered by the 2008 financial crisis? Not likely. Today, home equity positions remain strong, serving as a buffer against a pronounced rise in delinquencies. By contrast, nearly a quarter of homeowners by the fall of 2009 were underwater, meaning they owed more on homes than their properties were worth. Still, experts say the numbers suggest American homeowners are beginning to come under strain. “While the overall numbers remain below pre-pandemic levels, the persistent rise suggests that some homeowners are still facing financial challenges amid today’s housing and economic landscape,” said Rob Barber, CEO at Attom, in the report. Although the rise in foreclosures is prompting some concern, activity remains historically low. For context, Attom data shows 2024 foreclosure activity at 35% below 2019 levels, before the Covid-19 pandemic emerged and upended the housing market. 2024 foreclosure filings were down close to 90% compared to 2010, when they peaked at nearly 2.9 million. Near-Record Home Equity Helps Curb Foreclosures Sharga explains that a significant factor contributing to today’s comparatively low levels of foreclosure activity is that homeowners—including those in foreclosure—possess an unprecedented amount of home equity . Indeed, homeowner equity grew by nearly $600 billion between the first quarters of 2024 and 2025, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Although down from the record-high of $35.6 trillion in the second quarter of 2024, total homeowner equity stands at over $34.5 trillion—the fourth-highest value on record. Elevated home equity levels continue to perpetuate a high percentage of equity-rich mortgages (when an outstanding mortgage balance is at or below 50% of a home’s estimated market value). Over 46% of mortgaged homes were equity-rich during the first quarter of 2025, according to Attom’s latest U.S. Home Equity and Underwater Report. Although this percentage is below the 49.2% peak recorded in the second quarter of 2024 and 47.7% in the last quarter of 2024, the figure is still nearly double the 26.5% level posted in the first quarter of 2020, per Attom data. “For a homeowner in the early stage of foreclosure, that equity helps them avoid a foreclosure sale, either by leveraging the equity to pay down past due",

Will 2025 Be a Good Year To Buy a Home? Buying a house —in any market—is a highly personal decision. Because homes represent the largest single purchase most people will make in their lifetime, it’s crucial to be in a solid financial position before diving in. Use a mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly housing costs based on your down payment. But if you’re trying to predict what might happen in 2025, experts say this is probably not the best home-buying strategy . “The housing market—like so many other markets—is almost impossible to time,“ Orphe Divounguy, senior macroeconomist at Zillow Home Loans, says. “The best time for prospective buyers is when they find a home that they like, that meets their family’s current and foreseeable needs, and that they can afford.” Gumbinger agrees it’s hard to tell would-be homeowners to wait for better conditions. “More often, it seems the case that home prices generally keep rising, so the goalposts for amassing a down payment keep moving, and there’s no guarantee that tomorrow’s conditions will be all that much better in the aggregate than today’s,” he says. Divounguy says “getting on the housing ladder” is worthwhile to begin building equity and net worth. Pro Tips for Buyers and Sellers Here are some expert tips to increase your chances for an optimal outcome in this tight housing market. Pro Tips for Buying in Today’s Real Estate Market Hannah Jones, a senior economic research analyst at Realtor.com, offers this expert advice to aspiring buyers: Know your budget. Instead of focusing on price, figure out how much you can afford as a monthly payment. Your monthly housing payment is influenced by the price of the home, your down payment, mortgage rate, loan term, home insurance and property taxes. Be flexible about home size and location. Perhaps your budget is sufficient for a small home in your perfect neighborhood or a larger, newer home further out. Understanding your priorities and having some flexibility can help you move quickly when a suitable home enters the market. Keep an eye on the market where you hope to buy. Determine the area’s available inventory and price levels. Also, pay attention to how quickly homes sell. Not only will you be tuned in when something great hits the market, but you can also feel more confident moving forward with purchasing a well-priced home. A real estate agent can",

Determine the area’s available inventory and price levels. Also, pay attention to how quickly homes sell. Not only will you be tuned in when something great hits the market, but you can also feel more confident moving forward with purchasing a well-priced home. A real estate agent can help with this. Don’t be discouraged. Purchasing a home is one of the largest financial decisions you’ll ever make. Approaching the market confidently, armed with good information and grounded expectations, will take you far. Don’t let the hustle of the market convince you to buy something that’s not in your budget or not right for your lifestyle. …Always get pre-approved with a strong and reputable lender as soon as possible. Getting pre-approved will give you a much clearer understanding of your budget and what you can afford, it shows sellers that you’re a qualified buyer and it strengthens your offers. — Scott Bridges , senior managing director at Pennymac and Forbes Advisor advisory board member Pro Tips for Selling in Today’s Real Estate Market Gary Ashton, founder of The Ashton Real Estate Group of RE/MAX Advantage, has this expert advice for sellers: Research comparable home prices in your area. Sellers need to have the most up-to-date pricing intel on comparable homes selling in their market. Know the market competition and price the home competitively. In addition, understand that in some price points it’s a buyer’s market—you’ll need to be prepared to make some concessions. Make sure your home is in top-notch shape. Homes need to be in great condition to compete and create a strong “online curb appeal.” Well-maintained homes and attractive front yards are major features that buyers look for. Work with a local real estate agent. A real estate agent or team with a strong local marketing presence and access to major real estate portals can offer significant value and help you land a great deal. Don’t put off issues that require attention. Prepare the home by making any repairs or improvements. Removing any objections that buyers may see helps focus the buyer on the positive attributes of the home.

High interest rates and inflated home values have made purchasing a home challenging for first-time home buyers. Is it smart to buy real estate before a recession? If you’re in a financial position to buy a home you plan to live in for the long term, it won’t matter when you buy it because you will live in it through economic highs and lows. However, if you are looking to buy real estate as a short-term investment, it will come with more risk if you buy at the height before a recession. Was this article helpful?

Fine-tuning hyperparameters helps optimize model performance by selecting the best values for parameters like learning rate and batch size. Unlike model parameters, hyperparameters are set before training and influence the learning process. 1 2 Effective tuning can prevent overfitting or underfitting, leading to better generalization on unseen data. 3 Hyperparameter tuning is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of deep learning models. 4 04 GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV GridSearchCV exhaustively searches over specified hyperparameter values, ensuring the best combination but can be computationally expensive. RandomSearchCV samples a random subset of parameter combinations, making it faster and more efficient for large search spaces. 1 2 Both methods use cross-validation to assess model performance, reducing the risk of overfitting to the training data. 3 Choosing between GridSearchCV and RandomSearchCV depends on the time available and the size of the hyperparameter space. 4 05 Optuna Optuna is a modern, automated hyperparameter optimization framework that uses an efficient, trial-based search. It leverages techniques such as bayesian optimization to find optimal hyperparameters faster than grid or random search. 1 2 Optuna allows for dynamic pruning, stopping unpromising trials early to save computation. 3 Ideal for deep learning tasks with large search spaces, where traditional tuning methods may be inefficient. 4",
